# lswriteups

A simple CLI tool to get the links of original writeups from [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org).

If you paritcipate in CTFs and use ctftime for reading the writeups of tasks you couldn't solve, then you'll understand the pain it is to read a single writeup. If not then go to [ctftime](https://ctftime.org) and feel the pain :smirk:

This tool get you all those beautifully written `original writeups` link so you can easily read them.

Selection of writeups are done on the basis of the rating given to them, if all the writeups have the same rating then the link of the first writeup is selected.

### Usage

```bash
âžœ ./lswriteups -h
usage: main.py [-h] (-n NAME | -l LINK)

Easily get those precious writeups

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

required any one of them:
  -n NAME, --name NAME  search for writeups by CTF name
  -l LINK, --link LINK  search for writeups by CTF url
```

There is a choice, either you can enter the name of the CTF like `seccon` or `P.W.N` or you can provide direct link to the task of any CTF like `https://ctftime.org/event/639/tasks/`

* `./lswriteups -n seccon`
